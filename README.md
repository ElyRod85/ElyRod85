I have experience designing and customizing themes and plugins for  **WordPress**-based websites, besides being a journalist specialized in online media,  **SEO**, and  **copywriting**, and having formation in project management with  **agile methodologies**.

I'm currently looking for opportunities to switch from freelancing to working in a company where I can grow professionally.

## What I do :bulb:

### ✨ Front-End Development & Web Design
With expertise in **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and user interface (**UI**) design, I combine creativity and technical skills to deliver intuitive, user-friendly, and visually captivating web experiences.
